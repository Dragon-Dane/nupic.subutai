run_anomaly
===========

This directory contain some sample code for running anomaly detection on
numerical datasets.  The code includes the Anomaly Likelihood code used
within Grok to filter the raw CLA anomaly scores. The details were discussed in
my [May 2014 Hackathon talk](http://numenta.org/blog/#sessions)

To get help type:

```
python run_anomaly.py --help
```

To run all the data sets, type:

```
./run_all.sh
```

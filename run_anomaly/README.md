run_anomaly
===========

This directory contain some sample code for running anomaly detection on
numerical datasets, as well as some interesting datasets. The code relies on the
Anomaly Likelihood code used to filter the raw CLA anomaly scores. The details
were discussed in my [May 2014 Hackathon talk](http://numenta.org/blog/#sessions)

The Excel files contain charts and the results of running the commands below.


To get help type:

```
python run_anomaly.py --help
```

There's a convenience script to run all the data sets. Just type:

```
./run_all.sh
```

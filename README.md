Welcome!
========

This repository contains Subutai's nupic code and experiments. Some of
the directories are quite old and may not work with the latest versions
of NuPIC. Nevertheless, they worked at one point, and may spark some
ideas.


The directory `swarm_experiments` contain a tutorial demonstrating
swarming, handling multiple fields, noisy data, etc.

The directory `run_anomaly` contain some sample scripts for running
anomaly detection on numerical datasets.

The directory `ensembles` contains simple sample code for a predictor
that is an ensemble of HTM models. The ensemble gets better results
than any single HTM model.

The directory `anomaly_classification` contains a simple example showing
how to use classification for detecting known anomalies even if they
occur again.
